# Dynamic_Website

For my college project, I was tasked with creating a dynamic website. The website was inspired by https://nyaa.si/ and serves as a mirror of the original site.
## Project Description

The website mirrors https://nyaa.si/ by using their RSS feed to update the database accordingly. I added additional features to the website, including user creation, global comments, search filters using regex, and a download history.
## Technologies Used

I used the LAMP tech stack, which includes Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and Python. I also utilized BeautifulSoup4, Regex, PHPMyAdmin, RSS, CSV, Crontab, Virtual Machine, Pandas (briefly), Datetime (briefly) in the project.
## Repository Contents

The repository contains the source code of the project, which includes PHP, HTML, Python, and Bash scripts. I used PHPMyAdmin to manage the database. I also utilized RSS feeds to update the database, and Pandas and Datetime to manipulate data.
